# Fish_hunt


You play as a shark that hunts fish for its supper.
Being a greedy shark, you can't afford to leave too much Â´
of fish pass... After 3 missed fish, the game is lost.
The game is mouse controlled and continues endlessly, or until 3 fish have been missed (whichever comes first).


At the start of the game, the level is displayed for 3 seconds: Level 1.
After 3 seconds the text disappears and the first fish appears
on the screen.
In order to capture the fish, you have to click on the canvas with the mouse to
throw balls. Each fish caught raises the score by +1. However, the fish move: if a fish manages to get out of the screen without
captured, it is considered lost. After 3 missed fish, the
game ends and the game is lost.
The score is displayed on the screen and the number of missed fish remaining (initially
3) is represented by images of fish under the score.
For every 5 captured fish, the level of the game is increased: the fish
stop appearing for 3 seconds and the game displays the next number of
level, e.g.: Level 2.
